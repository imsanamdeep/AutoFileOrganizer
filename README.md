# AutoFileOrganizer

**AutoFileOrganizer** is a Python script that organizes files within a directory by categorizing them into folders based on file type. It's designed to keep your files organized and make it easy to locate various types of files, from images and documents to videos and archives.

## Key Features
- Organizes files into folders like **Images**, **Documents**, **Videos**, **Music**, and **Archives** based on file extensions.
- Automatically creates folders if they donâ€™t exist.
- Moves files with unrecognized extensions into an **Other** folder.
- Handles files without extensions by placing them in the **Other** folder.
- Simple to use and easy to customize.
