# AutoFileOrganizer
AutoFileOrganizer is a lightweight Python script that organizes files in a directory by sorting them into folders based on file type. This tool keeps files organized and clutter-free by grouping images, documents, videos, music, and archives into designated folders. Files with unrecognized extensions are moved to an "Other" folder for easy access.
